**What Is This Project? :**

- Using Node, Express and Speakeasy this project is an example of two factor authentication.
- The project is a backend application that allows one to register a user along with a secret as well as a separate token for extra authentication.
- Two factor authentication is an extra layer of security added to an user's basic email/password authentication. 
  An example of this would be providing your zip code when using your credit card.
